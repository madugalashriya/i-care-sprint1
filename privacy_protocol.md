# Privacy & Consent Protocol – Sprint 1

## Purpose
This document defines the ethical and consent-based sharing framework for the I Care system.

## Consent-Based Sharing
- Users must explicitly opt-in before sharing any data.
- Users may enable or disable sharing at any time.
- Only aggregated weekly summaries are shared with trusted profiles.

## Trusted Profiles
- Users can add trusted profiles (friends or family members).
- Trusted profiles only receive high-level trends.
- No raw daily data is shared.

## Ethical Boundaries
- The system does not provide medical diagnoses.
- Burnout risk scores are informational only.
- The system avoids alarming or clinical language.

## Data Privacy
- User data remains private unless explicitly shared.
- Users may delete or reset their data at any time.
